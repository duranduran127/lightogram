# lightogram
Takes an image in a certain format and creates a histogram of the light waves in the picture

The Idea behind the program is that this is a GUI that you can insert an image in a png. or jpeg. format 
for example and the program will take the image and create a histogram of the light waves that are in the picture

#WHY?
The reason you may want to have this program is if you analyze images freaquently and use some form of their spectral properties to do work with.
This way you have an automated process that will show you that the picture has more vegitation, more impervious surface, etc..

#HOW?
GUI interface creation with an input and possibly a drop down menu for options.
